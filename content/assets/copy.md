My bio via a phone call with an interviewer for a job I didn’t get, 9/26/19</Em><br/><br/>
              Hello? Yes you’ve reached Elliot Frank. Yes this is he.<br/><br/>
              Hi Jackie. Right, from [redacted]. Of course. Nice to hear from you.<br/><br/>
              Right, yup, so I’m a web developer and writer. Yea I know, they’re quite different. So in college I majored in English and math. 
              Pardon? Oh, University of Maryland. Yeah it’s sort of near D.C. You’ve been? 
              Yeah D.C. is great. One of my favorite parts of going to school was getting to visit there.<br/><br/>
              Anyway so in 2019 I moved to Chicago. Well right after college I worked for a company in Cambridge,
              Massachusetts writing code. My job title was data analyst but I was writing a lot of scripts in Python.
              Things to like move data around, connect different APIs together. So my title wasn’t “software engineer” 
              but basically I was writing code full-time. So it was there that I learned basic skills like using Git for version
              control, and how to release code in cycles, and Agile development.<br/><br/>
              But eventually I wanted to trnsition to web development. So I took some time off to learn the languages I was
              lacking in, like Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Once I had better fundamentals in those languages, from there learning
              React and Redux for frontend development wasn't too difficult. And since I had been working with
              Python it wasn't too difficult to learn enough Django to start building backends for apps I wanted to work on.
