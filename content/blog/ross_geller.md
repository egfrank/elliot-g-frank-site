A confession: I haven’t really watched that much of Friends, but I feel like I have, because I’ve read the Wikipedia articles about all the Friends-- 236 episodes distilled to a six articles. I think I have a handle on all the central plotlines: Chandler and Monica are friends, then they get married. Ross and Rachel are friends, then they get married, then they get divorced, and then they are in love. Joey and Phoebe are also some of the friends. 

Call me naive, but I think that is enough to “get” the show. If Seinfeld was a show about nothing, Friends was a show about, well, friends. Just as Seinfeld used that simple premise to explore the moral vacuousness of its characters, Friends was able to spin out countless drama from those relationships. As the seasons ticked on, the audience saw the characters mature, and almost as a countervailing force, the writers of the show began to incorporate more backstory of the characters. More references to their childhoods, even whole scenes, which were often of the most dated aspects of the show: think of Monica’s obesity, one of the most tone-deaf punchlines of the show.

However, the point these scenes was that the audience could see the emotional baggage and sexual hangups of the six characters stretching in two directions, forward as plot and back into the past. Psychoanalysis is a central, although maybe unconscious, theme to Friends. Flip to the literal first minute of the first episode, and we see Chandler recounting in detail a dream where he is standing naked in his high school cafeteria, his penis replaced by a phone on which his mother is calling him. 

And then enters Ross Geller. Who better embodies the sexual and social hang-ups that all the characters of Friends must learn to navigate. A few facts about Ross: He is a man whose second marriage begins and ends with a literal Freudian slip. A paleontologist, Ross is obsessed with the past, both prehistoric and prepubescent. It’s insinuated that his career is a sign of arrested development, a juvenile interest in dinosaurs that he never aged out of. His childhood crush on Rachel Green persists throughout the whole series, and the maturation of their relationship is, according to Wikipedia, “a nearly constant theme of Friends.” 

Ross is eager to paint himself a victim of his sexual id and a loser in relationships with women. His first line in the show is “Hi,” which David Schwimmer delivers with such angst, we can feel the air leaving the room.

His second line in the show is “I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck.”

He is talking about his divorce from a woman who recently came out of the closet. Unlucky in love, Ross always garners sympathy from his friends and studio audience, but on paper, Ross does not come out looking very good. Think of Ross’s famous line, perhaps the best-known catchphrase of the show. Are you thinking of the thing he screams at the woman he loves, to explain that it is okay that he cheated on her? 

His failed relationships are a symptom of Ross’s vexed relationships with all women, with whom Ross imagines himself constantly in competition. Towards his sister, he is snippy and immature. From Wikipedia: “a running theme in Ross's narrative is his competition with his younger sister, manifested through wrestling and paranoia.” Ross’s other female friend, Phoebe, is his comedic foil, frivolous and upbeat to his rational and pessimistic attitude. In season 9, the writers add a backstory that both makes physical their comedic sparring and illuminates the class divide between them: “it is revealed that Phoebe once mugged Ross (stealing a copy of the comic book Science Boy that Ross had created) when they were teenagers,” a violent incident for which Ross forces Phoebe to apologize. In retrospect, it’s hard not to have more sympathy for the 14-year-old girl growing up homeless during the most violent era in New York City history.

Towards his male friends, Ross is not competitive, but scared of the line between homosocial affection and sexual attraction, especially in his friendship with Joey. In one episode, he falls asleep being spooned by Joey and then must cope with his shame for wanting to recreate the scene later. It is a shame that queerness is always a punchline in the show, ironic even, because the men of Friends are almost constantly struggling against either masculinity or heterosexuality.

You know how we don’t know what dinosaurs really look like? Since all that remains in the fossil record are bones, scientists cannot entirely accurately illustrate dinosaurs because the soft flesh and feathers have all disintegrated. Am I doing the same thing here to Ross? What does one miss when they have not, for 80+ hours, watched the accumulation of break-ups and losses and felt for the man? There is a sentence from Ross’s Wikipedia page that makes me laugh in its final turn:

“Above all, Ross is portrayed as a very sweet, loving and adorable character who is always looking out for everyone's best interests and often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang (despite his ego, outbursts, and paranoia)”

Was that the alchemy of Friends, that they made the audience feel so deeply for a character, not in spite, but because of his “ego, outbursts, and paranoia”? Aren’t the people in our lives who we tolerate and love through their “ego, outbursts, and paranoia,” just, in a word, our friends.
